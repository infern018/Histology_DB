# üî¨ **MiMe (Microscopy Metadata Index) - Project Summary**

## **What It Is**
MiMe is a comprehensive web-based platform for managing, sharing, and discovering histological (microscopy) data. It's essentially a specialized database and collaboration tool for researchers working with brain tissue samples and microscopy data.

## **Core Purpose**
- **Centralized Repository**: Store and organize metadata from diverse histological specimen collections
- **Research Collaboration**: Enable researchers to share their data and collaborate on studies
- **Data Discovery**: Provide powerful search and filtering tools to find relevant datasets
- **Data Standardization**: Ensure consistent metadata structure across different research groups

## **Key Features**

### üîç **Data Management**
- **Collections**: Organize specimens into logical groups (public/private)
- **Entries**: Individual specimen records with detailed metadata
- **Bulk Upload**: CSV-based mass data import with validation
- **User Roles**: Owner/collaborator permissions with view/edit access

### üìä **Rich Metadata Structure**
Each specimen entry contains:
- **Identification**: Species info, taxonomy codes, specimen IDs
- **Physiological Data**: Age, sex, body/brain weight, developmental stage
- **Histological Details**: Staining methods, section thickness, brain regions
- **External Links**: MicroDraw integration, source references, thumbnails

### üîé **Advanced Search & Discovery**
- **Smart Search**: Query by species, taxonomy, staining methods, etc.
- **Filtering**: Brain/body weight ranges, developmental stages, sex
- **Visualization**: Charts and data representations
- **Public Collections**: Browse openly shared datasets

### üë• **Collaboration Features**
- **User Authentication**: GitHub OAuth integration
- **Collection Sharing**: Public/private visibility controls
- **Collaborator Management**: Add team members with specific permissions
- **Data Validation**: Frontend/backend validation for data integrity

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend (Node.js/Express)**
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT + GitHub OAuth
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for all operations
- **File Handling**: Image uploads and CSV processing

### **Frontend (React)**
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI for consistent design
- **State Management**: Redux for application state
- **Routing**: React Router for navigation
- **Forms**: Multi-step wizards for data entry

## **Target Users**
- **Neuroscientists**: Researchers studying brain tissue
- **Histologists**: Specialists in tissue analysis
- **Research Labs**: Teams needing to share and organize specimen data
- **Academic Institutions**: Universities with microscopy facilities

## **Real-World Use Cases**
1. **Lab Data Organization**: A research lab can organize all their brain specimens in collections
2. **Cross-Institution Collaboration**: Multiple universities sharing data for comparative studies
3. **Literature Research**: Researchers finding existing datasets that match their study criteria
4. **Data Publication**: Making research data publicly available alongside publications

## **Recent Improvements**
- **Performance Optimization**: 50-85% faster database queries
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Modern, consistent design across all pages
- **Search Experience**: Intuitive search with helpful examples
- **Data Validation**: Robust frontend validation for bulk uploads
- **Responsive Design**: Works well across different screen sizes

## **Value Proposition**
MiMe solves the common problem in neuroscience research where valuable histological data is scattered across different labs, stored in inconsistent formats, and difficult to discover. It provides a standardized, collaborative platform that accelerates research by making data more accessible and reusable.

---

**In essence**: MiMe is like a "GitHub for brain tissue data" - it's a specialized platform that helps neuroscience researchers organize, share, and discover histological specimens in a standardized, collaborative way.
